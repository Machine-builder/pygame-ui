# pygame-ui
My attempt at creating a fluid ui library built for pygame

# how-to-use
Just download the code, and run the test files - feel free to take a look at how they work!

Basic examples:

## A window with two widgets
```python
print("hey?")
```

# extra-notes
This code is awful, I'm aware - but I'd appreciate it if you don't go steal it and claim it as your own :P

# license
Please make sure to read the COPYING file before deciding to release your own versions of my code,
also feel free to add a PR to change anything or fix anything up
